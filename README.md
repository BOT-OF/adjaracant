Movie website that sources everything from adjaranet.

Live website: https://adjaracant.xyz/

If you want to run this locally you will also need a proxy server:
https://github.com/gigamarr/adjaracant_webserver

In case you're running it locally, before you build the project, you will also need to change axios' client's baseURL property in `src/services/adjaranetService.js`
